        <b>What is a set?.</b>
        A set is <em>formally</em> speaking, sets are atomic in mathematics.
        They have no definition. They are just "basic objects".
        You can try and define a set as an object in the universe of
        a theory designated as "set theory". This reduces the definition
        as to what we call "set theory", and this is not really a
        mathematical definition anymore.In naive settings, we say that
        sets are mathematical objects which are collections of mathematical
        objects, and that there is no meaning to order and repetition of the
        objects in the collection.
